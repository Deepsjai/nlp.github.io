      "Good afternoon. This is Pilar de la Garza, Head of Investor Relations for Walmex. Thank you for joining us today to review the results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2019. Today, with me is; Guilherme Loureiro, President and Chief Executive Officer for Walmart de México Centroamérica; and Olga González, Chief Financial Officer.\n",

These references only reflect management's expectations and are based upon currently available data.

      "Now it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Guilherme Loureiro.\n",
      "Guilherme Loureiro\n",
      "Thank you Pilar and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us to review Walmex fourth quarter and full year results. 2019 was a challenging year. All of you know, we dealt with adverse and uncertain socioeconomic conditions across the region. Nevertheless we're able to deliver and create shareholder value for our customers, associates, shareholders, communities and suppliers.\n",
      "Overall this past year has been a year of transformation investment. I'm very proud of our associates' hard work and progress. By executing against our strategic priorities and making the right investments we are building a stronger and even more customer-centric business that is positioned for sustainable long-term value creation.\n",
      "I would like to begin by discussing sales performance and then Olga will cover the financial results for the quarter. Please consider that when I talk about Central America, I'm making reference to figures on a constant currency basis. During the fourth quarter total revenue grew 4.7%, 5.3% in Mexico and 3.9% in Central America.\n",
      "For the full year 2019 Mexico grew total revenue by 5.7% and Central America by 3.4% which resulted in 4.9% consolidated revenue growth. Same-store sales continue to be our main growth driver. For the full year Mexico delivered 11.1% 2-year stack growth and Central America 2.5%.\n",
      "In Mexico all regions and formats delivered a positive performance. The north and south regions had their highest same-store sales growth followed by the center and metro regions which delivered softer growth due to the competitive dynamics and macro conditions in those regions.\n",
      "I will start with Sam's our fastest-growing format for the last four years. In Sam's we are focusing on improving our members' experience. So during the quarter, we had another edition of the social fest event, where we offer our members high-quality merchandise with great value especially on fresh items.\n",
      "During the event we also reinforced the value proposition for Plus members by offering exclusive items and prices which resulted in the sign-up of thousands of new members.\n",
      "I'm very pleased with the progress we have made with Walmart in terms of omnichannel. We have taken their leadership in seasonal events to the online world and successfully executed events such as El Fin Irresistible. We also leveraged our stores' network to serve customers in a seamless way and expanded the on-demand service to about 60% of our stores covering 59 seats. We will continue to deepen our digital relationship with our customers to strengthen their loyalty to Walmart even further.\n",
      "At Superama during the holiday season we're able to surprise our customers with special products and exhibitions primarily focused on fresh categories. We are also enabling our stores with technology such as electronic pricing tags and self-checkout to improve the shopping experience and productivity. Another example of progress in technology is the launch of the new Superama app which improved the conversion and overall customer satisfaction.\n",
      "In Bodega we are moving forward in terms of store expansion and omnichannel. In quarter four 2019, we opened 69 new stores and closed the year with 2035 stores reinforcing Bodega's position as the leading retailer in Mexico. We also stepped up our omnichannel. We opened more than 300 kiosks during the year taking our omnichannel offer to the most price-sensitive families with great results.\n",
      "Among our formats, Bodega suffered the greatest impact from the change in disbursement of government support programs, especially in the center and metro regions. The team is focused on reinforcing even further our price positioning and operating more efficiently to keep the productivity loop turning.\n",
      "Now looking at the performance by merchandise division. The Food and Consumables division was our main growth driver followed by general merchandise and apparel. As we have shared with you in past quarters, apparel sales were impacted by operational difficulties that stemmed from the issues we finished with the merchandising board at the beginning of the year.\n",
      "This has taken us to accelerate the execution of markdowns in order to maintain healthy inventories and resume growth. Our merchandising team is already capitalizing the benefits of the adoption of an end-to-end and more customer-centric way of working. We managed to coordinate the Walmex exclusive omnichannel event called El Fin Irresistible, which included one more day of sales in record time.\n",
      "During the event, our customers found amazing merchandise at unbeatable prices across all our formats. We drove double-digit gross sales growth despite a challenging base and e-commerce sales represented 8% of total sales during the event.\n",
      "The team is also doing a great effort to improve even further our price position. During the year we widened our price gap by 20 basis points to support our most price-sensitive customers in these challenging economic times. In Central America, Nicaragua delivered the highest same-store sales growth followed by Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\n",
      "Sales performance in Costa Rica served the greatest impact from the favorable macroeconomic dynamics in the account. During 2019, we expanded Coyol's distribution center in Costa Rica by more than 44000 square meters. With this expansion, the distribution center became the largest one in Central America.\n",
      "We are committed to continue to invest in Central America not just to reinforce our prices to better serve our customers but also to enable key assets in the region to continue to win in the future. Switching topics. 2019 was a year of good progress in omnichannel. We know the world is changing. Customers are shopping in different ways and we want to be there for them and meet their demand. We believe that in order to scale our omnichannel business and improve profitability, we need to leverage our strength, our stores, our merchant DNA and our service culture.\n",
      "In line with this we have been working to bring the best of the online and off-line worlds to better serve our customers. We're offering same-day delivery and thousands of everyday needs and about 12,000 general merchandise items for on-demand service in over 256 Walmart and Superama stores.\n",
      "We are expanding our reach to new customers through an extended catalog composed by recently reinforced 1P for the marketplace, where we have enrolled almost 1300 sellers. Our customers can find the extended offering on our online platforms and across the 894 kiosks operating in our Bodega and Walmart stores. We truly believe our physical footprint is a key competitive advantage and to benefit from it we have now 1,115 pickup locations operating across all formats, where customers can pick up their grocery and general merchandise orders with no additional cost.\n",
      "During the quarter, e-commerce sales grew 47% and GMV 53%. It represented 2% of Mexico sales and contributed 70 basis points to total growth. We still have a lot of work to do but I'm pleased that our 2019 results demonstrated solid progress against our plan. For the full year, e-commerce sales grew 52% accelerating from the 40% growth achieved in 2018 and GMV grew 61% driven by grocery. E-commerce now represents 1.5% of total Mexico sales and contributed 50 basis points to total sales growth.\n",
      "Looking at performance versus the market. During the quarter we outpaced the self-service and clubs market measured by ANTAD by 50 basis points. For the full year we surpassed ANTAD by 90 basis points. This marks five years growing faster than the competition on every consecutive quarter. We have been able to capitalize on market situations and more important to keep the share gains by winning our customers' loyalty with a consistent delivery of our value proposition. I'm very proud of the team for this great achievement.\n",
      "Moving to new store growth. During the quarter we opened 81 new stores, 73 in Mexico and nine in Central America. This compares to 57 stores opened in quarter four, 2019 2018. We continue to invest in the region despite an uncertain environment. In the full year we opened 161 stores, which represents the largest number of new store openings in more than five years.\n",
      "In 2019, new stores contributed 1.7% of total growth, slightly below the guidance, as 50% of the new stores opened during the fourth quarter and sales contribution from store openings in Central America was lower, given the market situation we are facing.\n",
      "As I mentioned at the beginning of the webcast, this has been a year of investment and we'd like to update you on one of our key projects, the logistics network we designed. In 2019, we opened two new distribution centers dedicated to e-commerce in Guadalajara and Monterrey and we expanded Coyol distribution center in Costa Rica. Currently three more distribution centers are under construction: one dedicated to e-commerce in Mexico city and two omni-channel DCs in Mérida and Chihuahua. We expect to open the three of them in the first half of 2020.\n",
      "To wrap up the first part of the webcast, let's talk about ESG. In October, we launched the Gigaton Project with the goal of avoiding emission of one billion tons of greenhouse effect gases in our value chain by 2025. Our suppliers are key for the success of this initiative. All of them are invited to be part of this effort.\n",
      "We also launched the second addition of Reciclamania an event for cues along creating a culture of recycling among our customers. We are working to make trust a competitive advantage, building trust for low prices with our associates and for the way we engage with the community we serve. We believe leading on social and environmental issues is good for our business, for our shareholders and for the countries in which we operate and we will continue to focus on these issues going forward.\n",
      "In summary, we are building the right foundations to better serve our customers and to strengthen our business. As we begin this New Year, we know we will face ongoing economic challenges. We remain focused on our strategic priorities, especially on growth and productivity, while getting all the ingredients in place for a strong omni-channel business.\n",
      "Now, I'll turn it over to Olga, who will cover the financial results.\n",
      "Olga González\n",
      "Thanks, Gui, and good afternoon to all of you. In order to provide the investment community a better view of the underlying performance of our business, we're including a retroactive estimation of the effect the adoption of the IFRS 16 will have had on the 2018 financial results.\n",
      "These pro forma 2018 figures are not audited, but are based on the 2018 audited reported results and adjusted with our best estimates to show the effects related to the adoption of the IFRS 16. Please note that all the reference that I would do to last year results are based on the 2018 pro forma figures.\n",
      "I will start by covering results in Mexico. We're facing a soft growth environment and more challenging competition. Nevertheless, we have been able to generate savings and apply them to improve our price position and maintain healthy inventory levels, while outpacing the market and growing operating income faster than revenues.\n",
      "During the fourth quarter, total revenues grew 5.3%. We leveraged expenses by 60 basis points to compensate a gross profit margin contraction of 30 basis points, which stemmed from price investments and from additional markdowns to maintain healthy inventories in the apparel division. Operating income increased 8.1% and EBITDA margin expanded by 20 basis points, reaching 12%.\n",
      "Now let's move to Central America. Please consider that when I'm talking about Central America, I am referring to figures on a constant currency basis. Total revenues increased 3.9%. Gross profit margin improved 10 basis points driven by more efficient negotiations with suppliers.\n",
      "As we announced on the November sales release, we reached a new agreement between our subsidiaries in Central America and Walmart Inc. for the payment of intellectual property royalties. This agreement is effective beginning in 2019, but the charge was registered in November, affecting fourth quarter 2019 SG&A by MXN1.6 billion. However, the underlying performance of the business remained healthy. Excluding this impact, we leveraged expenses by 30 basis points, as a result of a very disciplined productivity agenda that we're implementing across the region and EBITDA improved 100 basis points reaching 11.5%.\n",
      "Please remember that royalties will be recorded as expenses on a quarterly basis going forward. At a consolidated level, total revenues grew 4.7%. Gross profit increased 3.8% resulting in a 22.7% margin. The net result was impacted by the payment of royalties by MXN1.1 billion.\n",
      "Adjusting for the impact of the payments of royalties on the fourth quarter 2019, we continue to build on our financial strategy. We leveraged expenses by 60 basis points and funded strategic investments in prices, salaries, logistics, e-commerce and new stores. Operating income grew 8.7% ahead of total revenues growth of 4.7%. And EBITDA increased 8.3% reaching, an 11.9% margin.\n",
      "Now, let's review the results for the full year 2019. Mexico total revenues increased 5.7%. During the year, SG&A grew 3.5%, 220 basis points below total revenue growth reflecting our productivity efforts and expense management.\n",
      "Gross profit grew 5.3% and gross profit margin decreased by 10 basis points to 22.6%. As a result operating income increased 8.3% and EBITDA 8.6%, resulting in an 11.4% EBITDA margin.\n",
      "In Central America, total revenues increased 3.4%. Gross profit margin remained stable at 24.2%, as the team was able to reinforce our price leadership without reducing profitability. SG&A grew 10.8% impacted by the new royalty charges. Operating income represented 5.8% of sales and EBITDA margin was 9.1%.\n",
      "2019 results were solid. In both regions, the team made good progress on cost controls and we were able to maintain expenses growth below total revenue growth. This allowed us to invest in prices to keep winning our customers loyalty and to further improve our competitive position.\n",
      "Consolidated revenues increased 4.9%. SG&A increased 4.6%. Gross profit margin decreased 10 basis points to 22.9%. As a result, operating income increased 4.7% and EBITDA margin expanded by 10 basis points.\n",
      "Capital allocation is aligned with the long-term strategy. During 2019, we made strategic investments to better position our business, while continuing to generate returns. In line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, we invested MXN20.6 million, 14.7% more than in 2018. 40% of the investment was allocated to the remodeling and maintenance of existing stores 28% to the opening of new stores, 20% to the logistics network redesign, 11% to technology and e-commerce and 1% to fresh upstreaming projects.\n",
      "In addition, we're reducing our base expenses by implementing technology to operate more efficiently and becoming more productive in our remodels and new store investments, thereby freeing capital to build strong foundations.\n",
      "Moving to the balance sheet. Our financial strength gave us the ability to deliver short-term results, while we build structural competitive advantages to position the business for the long-term. We closed the year with a cash position of MXN30.9 billion, 20.5% less than last year, given that the dividend paid in 2019 was 41% larger than the one paid in 2018.\n",
      "Inventories increased 6.6% primarily impacted by the opening of 81 new stores in the quarter, 24 new stores more than in fourth quarter 2018. Cash generation increased 5.4% ahead of total revenue growth reaching MXN63.7 billion. After investing MXN20.6 billion in higher return projects, we returned MXN36 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We're committed to delivering consistent return to shareholders, while investing for the future.\n",
      "Today, the Walmex Board of Directors agreed to recommend a proposal to shareholders for an ordinary dividend of MXN0.87 per share and an extraordinary dividend of MXN0.92 per share. Total dividends add up to MXN1.79 per share. We expect the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held on March 24, 2020 to vote on the proposal.\n",
      "The proposed schedule for dividend payment is as follows. Ordinary dividends will be paid in three installments. The first one of MXN0.27 per share in June, and the second and third ones of MXN0.30 per share in November and December 2020. Extraordinary dividends will be paid in two installments. The first one of MXN0.45 per share on November 2020, and the second one of MXN0.47 per share on December 2020.\n",
      "In closing, I would like to summarize the highlights of 2019. Despite a challenging environment, our operational standards and clear value proposition have allowed us to continue to grow ahead of the market. We're driving profitability improvement while transforming our company to position it for the future.\n",
      "We remain confident that the investments we're making in our business are key to balance short and long-term results. We know 2020 will present new challenges. And all of us at Walmex are committed to delivering for our customers and shareholders. Throughout the years, we have built a resilient business capable of adapting to changing economic conditions.\n",
      "To finalize, I would like to invite you to our Walmex Day, which will be held on March 18 and 19 in Merida, Yucatan. We will be visiting our first omni-channel distribution center, which will further strengthen our network capabilities. You can register for the event with our Investor Relations team.\n",

Cheng. Please go ahead, sir.\\nS.J. Cheng\\nYes. Thank you, David. We appreciate everyone joining our call today. This has been a challenging quarter for all of us as we manage in the coronavirus ‘19 world. As a result of our effort, we were able to restart also the manufacturing facility of Asia after the Chinese New Year targeted closure with no additional delay or disruption. We have worked closely with our customer and supply chain allowing us to maintain full inventory level to ensure uninterrupted service to customers. We are taking coronavirus ‘19 seriously and then we will continue to improve all safety measures.\\nLet me now turn to our Q1 results, the big takeaway for Q1 first, Q1 was a great quarter for us with the revenue up 25% over Q1 2019 and as of 5 years, the highest record level. We achieved this despite few working days due to Chinese New Year’s closure and coronavirus ‘19. Q1 revenue was up 0.3% over Q4 ‘19 while the impact has normally caused the seasonal decline. Second, gross profit increased 90% in Q1 ‘20 compared to Q1 ‘19 and up 0.3% compared to Q4 ‘19. We have been driven highest profit with a more favorable end-market mix and key product cost out. Third, net earnings increased 233% in Q1 ‘20 compared to the Q1 ‘19 and was up 34% compared to Q4 ‘19. Finally, our overall utilization rate improved to 79% in Q1 ‘20 compared to 70% in Q1 ‘19 and 76% in Q4 ‘19. This is significantly improved and is allowing us to drive the improvement across our financial metrics.\\nWe feel confident about our capacity footprint moving into Q2 and that we are taking a very conservative approach of CapEx. We are lowering our capacity investments where possible as we focus on improvements through automation, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity in order to maintain our leading market position in the uncertain market. For the first quarter of 2020, we have benefit from growth in our DRAM, NAND flash and AH COF business. Demand was driven by ongoing 5G growth. We also see strong uptick in Q1 in demand for work and school from home. This combined positive demand help us offset fewer working days in Q1.\\nAs I mentioned at the start of the call that our focus has been on employee health and delivery for our customers, we occupied a critical space in the supply chain for our customers. By providing service during the coronavirus ‘19 crisis, we have helped ensure inventory stability for our customers. This helped us increase our overall utilization level to 79% in Q1 ‘20 from 70% in Q1 ‘19 and 76% in Q4 ‘19. With major utilization aimed in both our assembly and bumping production line, we saw pickup in demand from applications related to process, storages, set-top box and 5G base station, demand for memory. Our utilization of assembly and testing fell at the same level with Q4. Utilization rate of the LCD and bumping significantly improved led by demand for COF tablet, laptop and notebook for work and school from home demand.\\nIn terms of adding color on Q1, [indiscernible] product represents between 10% to 11% of total Q1 revenue, assembly product line represents around 26%, [indiscernible] and package testing represent 9% and 13% respectively. Memory total revenue growth around 3% and represents 42.1% of total Q1 revenue, up from 39.2% of Q4 ‘19. Revenue from DRAM and end-to-end product represents about 30.1% of total Q1 revenue. Revenue from flash represented about 22% of total Q1 revenue, NAND flash business continued to grow and represent about 50% of Q1 gross revenue.\\nAs for driver IT-related products, revenue increased to 47.4% total Q1 revenue, this including gold bump and COG and COF. Demand growth from tablet, desktop and notebook from work and school from home offset seasonal low for few working days in Q1. TDDI product revenue represents about 39% of Q1 DDIC revenue and was impacted by broader market softening in smartphones in Q1. We see benefit from appreciation using OLED standard for full HD grade panel in smartphone. OLED driver product revenue increased significantly and represents about more than 9% of Q1 DDIC compared to 7% of Q4. [indiscernible] revenue in Q1 represent about 50% of DDIC revenue as the TDDI penetration rate continued to increase in HD grade panel, average price for OLED panel emerging full HD grade panel. Regarding to the end market, revenue from smart mobile represents about 36% of total Q1 revenue. The TV category represents about 19% and consumer category represents about 22%. Revenue from computing represented about 12% of total Q1 revenue. Automobile and industry contributed to increase to 11% and to be a long-term growth area for us.\\nAs we look forward into the second quarter of 2020, I am very proud of the ChipMOS’ team for remaining focused during this challenging period. Area in Asia, are starting to see the demand pickup with working returning to normal. Other parts of the world, including Europe and the U.S., continue to be impact. We are managing our expense and cash and keeping the conservative approach to CapEx as we work through the coronavirus ‘19 environment. Our gross long-term relationship with the banks recently had given us credit line of around $80 per billion with good terms, including lower rates for the hedging level accountability and then the confidence of our balance sheet and operations.\\nFrom demand standpoint, we are positive about the market position. In general, we expect growth of the memory product will be higher than DDIC product in 2019. We are encouraged by healthy demand from memory customer. We expect dealer will be stable with a steady demand for cloud storage and set-top box. We also expect NAND flash business will increase, led by continued pricing in 5G network throughout globally and gaming demand. NAND flash should be continued to grow as we move into Q2.\\nIn DDIC, flat panel for tablet/notebook demand should remain stable. Large panel for TV demand have been soft, but with everyone trying that may change. Small flat panel have been impacted by smartphone weakness recently. However, TDDI continues to grow with higher penetration rate of HD grade panel and OLED in emerging of the full HD grade panel in 2020 despite ongoing pressure on other unit sales. Silicon flat panel is still going up in particular more and more display panels are being used in cars. These are big long-term opportunity for ChipMOS given our customer base.\\nFinally, you may have already read the full resolution we filed with SEC today. One of the resolutions related to application for retirement of Mr. Lafair Cho, Senior Executive Vice President and COO, I would like to thank Lafair for his tireless effort to the company on behalf of ChipMOS and personally, I expressed my appreciation to him for assisting me over the years. Lafair will continue to contribute his expertise and experience, inclusive of Japan business and customer maintenance as a consultant to the company. After his retirement effective of July 1 from on then he will be assisting the two newly appointed Executive Vice President, Mr. D.Y. Tsai and Mr. Vincent Hsu to smooth take over all operation responsibility during the transition period.\\nNow, let me turn the call over to Ms. Silvia to review the first quarter 2020 financial results. Silvia, please go ahead.\\nSilvia Su\\nThank you, A.J. All dollar amounts stated in our presentation are in NT dollars. We have provided both U.S. dollars and NT dollars in our press release. The following numbers are based on exchange rates of NT$30.25 against $1 as of March 31, 2020. All the figures were prepared in accordance with Taiwan International Financial Reporting Standards. To help make the presentation easier to follow, my comments will go along with the investor presentation on our Investor Relations website published today.\\nPage 12, consolidated operating results summary. For the first quarter of 2020, total revenue was $184.7 million. Net profit attributable to the company was $23.6 million in Q1.

EBITDA for Q1 was $52.9 million. EBITDA was calculated by adding depreciation and amortization together with operating profit. Return on equity of Q1 was 14.3%.\\nPage 13, consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Compared to last quarter, total Q1 revenue was $184.7 million, up 0.3% compared to Q4 2019. Gross profit was $42 million in Q1, with Q1 gross margin at 22.7% was same as Q4 2019. Our operating expenses in Q1 were $13.1 million or 7.1% of our Q1 revenue, which is about 1% higher than Q4 2019. Operating profit for Q1 was $29.7 million and operating profit margin for Q1 was 16.1%, decreased 0.1 percent points compared to 16.2% in Q4 2019. Net non-operating expenses in Q1 were $0.1 million compared to net non-operating expenses in Q4 2019 of $7.4 million. The difference between Q1 and Q4 2019 is mainly due to the increase of net foreign exchange gains, $6.7 million and the decrease of the share of loss of associates accounted for using equity methods, $0.9 million. Net profit in Q1 was $23.6 million compared to $17.9 million in Q4 2019. The difference between Q1 and Q4 2019 is mainly due to increase of net foreign exchange gains, $6.7 million.\\nNet earnings for the first quarter of 2019 were $0.03 per basic common shares compared to $0.02 per basic common shares for Q4 of 2019. Basic weighted average outstanding shares were 727.2 million shares. Compared to the same period of last year, total revenue for Q1 was $184.7 million, which was up 25.2% compared to the same period of 2019.

Net non-operating expenses in Q1 were $0.5 million compared to $2.1 million in Q1 2019. The difference is mainly due to the increase of net foreign exchange gains, $1.1 million and the decrease of the share of loss associated accounting for using equity method of $1 million. Net profit in Q1 was $23.6 million compared to $6.4 million in Q1 2019. The difference is mainly due to the increase of gross profit $19.9 million, net foreign exchange gain, $1.1 million and partially offset by an increase of income tax expense, $4 million. Net earnings for the first quarter of 2020 were $0.03 per basic common share compared to $0.01 per basic common share for Q1 of 2019.\\nPage 14, consolidated statement of financial position and key indices. Total assets at the end of Q1 were $1.3 billion, including current asset of $513.8 million. Total liabilities at the end of the Q1 were $592.5 million, including current liability of $149.1 million. Total equity at the end of Q1 was $671.4 million. Accounts receivable turnover days in Q1 were 75 days compared to 80 days in Q4 of 2019. Inventory turnover days were 44 days in Q1 compared to 38 days in Q4 of 2019.\\nPage 15 consolidated statement of cash flow. Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of Q1 were $155.5 billion. Net cash generated from operating activities was $24.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $47.4 million. Net cash generated from financing activity was $415.9 million. We took the opportunity in the first quarter to add to our cash balance through local bank loans at favorable low rates. This allowed us to add an additional $115.3 million in cash on our financial position. As of March 31, 2020, our balance of cash and cash equivalents was $248.3 million. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $18.3 million. Free cash flow was calculated by adding depreciation of financial interest income together with operating profit and then subtracting CapEx, interest expense, income tax expense and dividend.\\nPage 16 capital expenditure and depreciation. We invested $37.6 million in CapEx in Q1. This is down from $56.3 million in Q4. The breakdown of CapEx was 10.1% for bumping, 46.2% for LCD driver, 5% for assembly and 34.7% for testing. Depreciation expenses were $33.2 million in Q1. As of April 30, 2020, the company’s outstanding ADS number was approximately 5 million units, which represent around a 12.8% of the company’s outstanding common shares. Operator that concludes our formal remarks, we can now take questions.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Scott Bishins with Caffeine Holdings LLC.\\nScott Bishins\\nYes, hi, Silvia, hi, S.J. How are you? I just want to say a great quarter all around, probably the best I have seen at least 10 years if not longer. Couple of questions I have. Maybe I will just go through these. It looks like your revenue is stronger than the overall industry can you keep up that high level through the rest of 2020?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nScott, to answer your question, I think for the first half will be pretty good, because we also published the April revenue we interfaced and for May and June will be slightly down. And for the second half, only speaking, right now, the memory is more stable than the LCD driver, because of the – our memory customers are more stable and also give us a commitment for the second half. Regarding the driver, only speaking, the pictures here are also of uncertainty, but we will carefully walk step-by-step. And for the second half, we are conservative for the CapEx investment in order to maintain more cash in this uncertain environment. So I hope this can answer your question.\\nScott Bishins\\nOkay. Where do you think the CapEx would be for the second half? Exactly how much do you spend?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nPreviously, the past 2 years, our CapEx investment is around at 25% of total revenue. I think this year, management team set a target to the company, will be less than 20% of our – this year’s revenue.\\nScott Bishins\\nOkay. That’s great. How much of the revenue growth is coming from higher ASPs or from more unit growth?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nFrom both, because of the product mix. For LCD driver, as an example, the OLED and TDDI, their penetration rate, getting higher and higher. That is a favorable product mix for us, that being the LCD driver area, there being longer testing time and also more bumping service. And then for – memory wise, more and more customers getting for automobile and industry, that need a higher quality and also more stable forecast for the long term. So – and for quality wise, we also increased a lot because we invest a lot of resource into the separate [indiscernible] for process and also automation in online and AI in online. So like in 2019, our revenue increased around 10%, while our total headcount is reduced around 10%. In case, our gross margin also maintain the variable income continue to increase, and this year will be same. We will try to maintain the same headcount and continue to increase our revenue in order to further contribute the benefit to the company and also share the benefit to the shareholders.\\nScott Bishins\\nThat sounds great. That’s very encouraging. Seeing that there’s tight utilization, are there opportunities for increasing prices also?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nActually, under the current environment, for memory wise, yes, we see that a little bit. But regarding the LCD driver, I don’t think that is a good timing, yes.\\nScott Bishins\\nOkay. Do you need a good recovery in the LCD driver between the smartphones and the televisions’ demand to continue on a double-digit growth path?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nOnly speaking for this year, I think, the second half LCD driver, pace of the current demand will be a little bit weak compared with the first half due to the weak smartphone demand, yes.\\nScott Bishins\\nRight. I mean so far, this year, you’ve been on a very strong path the first quarter and looks like April was a very good month, too, actually the best, I guess, in the history of ChipMOS. Do you feel that if we stay on the same product mix that we have today, will that allow us, for full year, to be still at double digits in growth?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nOnly speaking, you can – Scott, let me put this for the first half. For the Q1 compared with that period of last year, we increased revenue around 25%. And for the Q2, I think still has around 30% discounted rate. So for the first half, our revenue increase compared with same period last year will be more than 20%. And even we take a very conservative forecast for the second half or it will be same like last year. So maybe we still had a high single-digit revenue growth for – compared with the last year. So we have strong confidence we can deliver good results to the market and also maintain the high cash dividend policy to the shareholder.\\nScott Bishins\\nThat’s great. Considering all the adversity that’s going on now with the virus and the unknowns for us to have a growth trajectory like that for year 2020 is – it’s amazing. It just shows you how well the company is doing and how well you guys are running the whole operation. It’s really great. I have just a couple more questions. I think I saw somewhere in your remarks. It said something about seeing a lot of demand coming from, I guess, for computing from people that are working at home and school also being thwarted at home. Do you see that continuing into the second half also?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nYes. The answer is yes. Not only for the work from home, but also the other one is very important, it’s gaming requirements.\\nScott Bishins\\nOkay. Yes, that’s where it seems to be. I’ve seen other reports from other companies, talking about how they’ve lost themselves, I guess, in the retail stores, but they’re picking up a lot of sales that are buying and computers and also other devices that – to use them from home. So that seems like it could be a trend for a while. Is there any more opportunity, you believe, that – I know the gross margins were great at 22.7%. Do you see any chance that, in the short-term, that, that might improve also?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nThrough automation and UPS improvement without a new CapEx investment, we try our best to do so.\\nScott Bishins\\nOkay. I didn’t – I haven’t seen the depreciation numbers. Do they still stay on an upward trend or they start to decline coming into the second half of the year?\\nSilvia Su\\nYes. For the depreciation, as you know, that we could invest the CapEx, so the depreciation for quarter-over-quarter, it will increase, I think, 3% to 4% quarter-by-quarter for the depreciation.\\nScott Bishins\\nOkay, when does it start to get down, any time this year or not until next year as your CapEx?\\nSilvia Su\\nYes, maybe in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2021.\\nScott Bishins\\nOkay. Yes, I just want to model that into my financials. Let me just see – a couple – just a couple more questions. Is more capacity still moving out of China into Taiwan based on what’s going on with the U.S. tariffs?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nThe answer is yes. We take a lot of advantages, especially for U.S., Europe and Japan, a lot of other competitors, which is great and sure. And for auto, they also would like to ask between the capacity for them. Therefore, outside China company. And inside China, we also get lot of like benefit because the coronavirus issue, because the local logistic system will get another impact due to the coronavirus issue. So previously, China is pretty aggressive to the infrastructure by their sales, would like to keep majority in supply chain in China. But right now, this coronavirus issue, they were like 50:50, both in China and outside. So we get a benefit.\\nScott Bishins\\nOkay. Actually, two more questions. Are you maintaining the normal level of inventory during this pandemic or do you need to stock up because of shortages in components needed to do final assembly?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nYes. Actually, we increased around two weeks to one month material inventory in order to support the customer, because during this critical period, the transportation and logistics are big issues. That’s first one. The second one is seeing that IC requirement is pretty strong, so material supply lead times are getting longer. So we negotiate with customers with the guarantee. So we expect an increase in our material inventory in order to present enough capacity and materials to support customers.\\nScott Bishins\\nOkay. Yes, that sounds good. That sounds like it’s the prudent thing to do. One last question, I have been reading a lot of articles about our partner in China, the memory – I believe it’s Tsinghua Memory.\\nS.J. Cheng\\nYes.\\nScott Bishins\\nI see there is a lot of reports out that they’re really starting to ramp up their 128 NAND flash components’ chips. And it looks like they say they’re going to be going into full production sometime between – around the end of the year. Is that going to bode well for our China factory as they are now under the same umbrella?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nTo answer your question, as you can see, the Q1 result is better than Q4. One of the key reason is Shanghai operation performance improved a lot due to the YMTC support and COF capacity for that – and that’s, I think, for last quarter. Right now, to have the major shareholders into YMTC and new Chairman also is the CEO of the YMTC. So they had a full obligation and apparently to few other Shanghai operations.\\nScott Bishins\\nHow do we stand as far as – are we close to a breakeven?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nI think what we previously laid out has given this very data, yes. After the virus, each of this will be overcome. I think that we will breakeven pretty soon, yes.\\nScott Bishins\\nPretty soon. Okay. Well again thank you very much like I said before, this is the best report I’ve seen in many, many years. And it certainly seems like there’s a lot of growth ahead for us. Just continue doing the great job and we’re here. And we’re just very excited about what the future looks like. So thank you very much, to both of you.\\nS.J. Cheng\\nJust go ahead to buy more stock and you will benefit on it, yes.\\nScott Bishins\\nI will, for sure.\\nS.J. Cheng\\nThank you.\\nSilvia Su\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] We’ll go next to Vipul Sagar with Blash Capital. Please go ahead.\\nVipul Sagar\\nGood evening S.J. Good evening Silvia. I just want to say a really impressive April revenue number, really impressive gross margin number. And I was really, really happy about the free cash flow so I just want to ask a question about the rest of the year. Last quarter, you told us that you expect positive free cash flow for the whole year. Is that still the case?\\nSilvia Su\\nYes. Yes, for 2020, we expect that we can have a positive free cash flow. Yes.\\nVipul Sagar\\nOkay. And Scott already asked the question about the Shanghai, and that is really impressive that they had a good improvement in the Q1. Down the road, how do we get more information on how it’s contributing to ChipMOS Taiwan? I mean, how do we – do you – are you planning to like include some stuff in your press release about the things that are happening in ChipMOS Shanghai with YMTC being the major shareholder now? Or you just keep that separate?\\nS.J. Cheng\\nActually, I think according to regulations, we don’t make [indiscernible] regarding the shareholder change. Because they transferred from Unigroup to YMTC, that’s a major shareholder succession. So right now, the one they occupy more than 50% of the share for Shanghai. The company name already changed from ChipMOS Shanghai to Unimos Shanghai. And the YMTC CEO also took the Chairman position of the Unimos Shanghai. And government upped their program, this is China government and also Shanghai given about the R&D project fee and also for the tax incentive. So – and YMTC also supported voting for the proximity. So I think under this kind of situation, the situation will be improved better and better. And YMTC also can benefit from this investor. So this will be a win-win situation.\\nVipul Sagar\\nOkay. Thank you so much. I just want to say, once again, a really impressive quarter. And obviously, Taiwan is doing so much better with the coronavirus. I mean that government has done an amazing job in keeping its population safe. So thank you, again, and talk to you next quarter.\\nS.J. Cheng\\nThank you.\\nSilvia Su\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And it appears we have no questions at this time. I’d like to turn it back to management for closing remarks.\\nS.J. Cheng\\nYes. Thank you everyone who joined our Q1 conference call. Thank you very much. And please get in touch if you have any further questions. Thank you. Bye-bye.\\nSilvia Su\\nBye-bye.\\nOperator\\nAnd that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\\n'"

We appreciate everyone joining our call today. This has been a challenging quarter for all of us as we manage in the coronavirus ‘19 world. As a result of our effort, we were able to restart also the manufacturing facility of Asia after the Chinese New Year targeted closure with no additional delay or disruption. We have worked closely with our customer and supply chain allowing us to maintain full inventory level to ensure uninterrupted service to customers. We are taking coronavirus ‘19 seriously and then we will continue to improve all safety measures. Let me now turn to our Q1 results, the big takeaway for Q1 first, Q1 was a great quarter for us with the revenue up 25% over Q1 2019 and as of 5 years, the highest record level. We achieved this despite few working days due to Chinese New Year’s closure and coronavirus ‘19. Q1 revenue was up 0.3% over Q4 ‘19 while the impact has normally caused the seasonal decline. Second, gross profit increased 90% in Q1 ‘20 compared to Q1 ‘19 and up 0.3% compared to Q4 ‘19. We have been driven highest profit with a more favorable end-market mix and key product cost out. Third, net earnings increased 233% in Q1 ‘20 compared to the Q1 ‘19 and was up 34% compared to Q4 ‘19. Finally, our overall utilization rate improved to 79% in Q1 ‘20 compared to 70% in Q1 ‘19 and 76% in Q4 ‘19. This is significantly improved and is allowing us to drive the improvement across our financial metrics. We feel confident about our capacity footprint moving into Q2 and that we are taking a very conservative approach of CapEx. We are lowering our capacity investments where possible as we focus on improvements through automation, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity in order to maintain our leading market position in the uncertain market. For the first quarter of 2020, we have benefit from growth in our DRAM, NAND flash and AH COF business. Demand was driven by ongoing 5G growth. We also see strong uptick in Q1 in demand for work and school from home. This combined positive demand help us offset fewer working days in Q1. As I mentioned at the start of the call that our focus has been on employee health and delivery for our customers, we occupied a critical space in the supply chain for our customers. By providing service during the coronavirus ‘19 crisis, we have helped ensure inventory stability for our customers. This helped us increase our overall utilization level to 79% in Q1 ‘20 from 70% in Q1 ‘19 and 76% in Q4 ‘19. With major utilization aimed in both our assembly and bumping production line, we saw pickup in demand from applications related to process, storages, set-top box and 5G base station, demand for memory. Our utilization of assembly and testing fell at the same level with Q4. Utilization rate of the LCD and bumping significantly improved led by demand for COF tablet, laptop and notebook for work and school from home demand. In terms of adding color on Q1, [indiscernible] product represents between 10% to 11% of total Q1 revenue, assembly product line represents around 26%, [indiscernible] and package testing represent 9% and 13% respectively. Memory total revenue growth around 3% and represents 42.1% of total Q1 revenue, up from 39.2% of Q4 ‘19. Revenue from DRAM and end-to-end product represents about 30.1% of total Q1 revenue. Revenue from flash represented about 22% of total Q1 revenue, NAND flash business continued to grow and represent about 50% of Q1 gross revenue. As for driver IT-related products, revenue increased to 47.4% total Q1 revenue, this including gold bump and COG and COF. Demand growth from tablet, desktop and notebook from work and school from home offset seasonal low for few working days in Q1. TDDI product revenue represents about 39% of Q1 DDIC revenue and was impacted by broader market softening in smartphones in Q1. We see benefit from appreciation using OLED standard for full HD grade panel in smartphone. OLED driver product revenue increased significantly and represents about more than 9% of Q1 DDIC compared to 7% of Q4. [indiscernible] revenue in Q1 represent about 50% of DDIC revenue as the TDDI penetration rate continued to increase in HD grade panel, average price for OLED panel emerging full HD grade panel. Regarding to the end market, revenue from smart mobile represents about 36% of total Q1 revenue. The TV category represents about 19% and consumer category represents about 22%. Revenue from computing represented about 12% of total Q1 revenue. Automobile and industry contributed to increase to 11% and to be a long-term growth area for us. As we look forward into the second quarter of 2020, I am very proud of the ChipMOS’ team for remaining focused during this challenging period. Area in Asia, are starting to see the demand pickup with working returning to normal. Other parts of the world, including Europe and the U.S., continue to be impact. We are managing our expense and cash and keeping the conservative approach to CapEx as we work through the coronavirus ‘19 environment. Our gross long-term relationship with the banks recently had given us credit line of around $80 per billion with good terms, including lower rates for the hedging level accountability and then the confidence of our balance sheet and operations. From demand standpoint, we are positive about the market position. In general, we expect growth of the memory product will be higher than DDIC product in 2019. We are encouraged by healthy demand from memory customer. We expect dealer will be stable with a steady demand for cloud storage and set-top box. We also expect NAND flash business will increase, led by continued pricing in 5G network throughout globally and gaming demand. NAND flash should be continued to grow as we move into Q2. In DDIC, flat panel for tablet/notebook demand should remain stable. Large panel for TV demand have been soft, but with everyone trying that may change. Small flat panel have been impacted by smartphone weakness recently. However, TDDI continues to grow with higher penetration rate of HD grade panel and OLED in emerging of the full HD grade panel in 2020 despite ongoing pressure on other unit sales. Silicon flat panel is still going up in particular more and more display panels are being used in cars. These are big long-term opportunity for ChipMOS given our customer base. Finally, you may have already read the full resolution we filed with SEC today. One of the resolutions related to application for retirement of Mr. Lafair Cho, Senior Executive Vice President and COO, I would like to thank Lafair for his tireless effort to the company on behalf of ChipMOS and personally, I expressed my appreciation to him for assisting me over the years. Lafair will continue to contribute his expertise and experience, inclusive of Japan business and customer maintenance as a consultant to the company. After his retirement effective of July 1 from on then he will be assisting the two newly appointed Executive Vice President, Mr. D.Y. Tsai and Mr. Vincent Hsu to smooth take over all operation responsibility during the transition period. Now, let me turn the call over to Ms. Silvia to review the first quarter 2020 financial results. Silvia, please go ahead. Silvia Su Thank you, A.J.

Net non-operating expenses in Q1 were $0.1 million compared to net non-operating expenses in Q4 2019 of $7.4 million. The difference between Q1 and Q4 2019 is mainly due to the increase of net foreign exchange gains, $6.7 million and the decrease of the share of loss of associates accounted for using equity methods, $0.9 million. Net profit in Q1 was $23.6 million compared to $17.9 million in Q4 2019. The difference between Q1 and Q4 2019 is mainly due to increase of net foreign exchange gains, $6.7 million.

Net profit in Q1 was $23.6 million compared to $6.4 million in Q1 2019. The difference is mainly due to the increase of gross profit $19.9 million, net foreign exchange gain, $1.1 million and partially offset by an increase of income tax expense, $4 million. Net earnings for the first quarter of 2020 were $0.03 per basic common share compared to $0.01 per basic common share for Q1 of 2019.

Page 16 capital expenditure and depreciation. We invested $37.6 million in CapEx in Q1. This is down from $56.3 million in Q4. The breakdown of CapEx was 10.1% for bumping, 46.2% for LCD driver, 5% for assembly and 34.7% for testing. Depreciation expenses were $33.2 million in Q1. As of April 30, 2020, the company’s outstanding ADS number was approximately 5 million units, which represent around a 12.8% of the company’s outstanding common shares. Operator that concludes our formal remarks, we can now take questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Scott Bishins with Caffeine Holdings LLC. Scott Bishins Yes, hi, Silvia, hi, S.J. How are you? I just want to say a great quarter all around, probably the best I have seen at least 10 years if not longer. Couple of questions I have. Maybe I will just go through these. It looks like your revenue is stronger than the overall industry can you keep up that high level through the rest of 2020? S.J. Cheng Scott, to answer your question, I think for the first half will be pretty good, because we also published the April revenue we interfaced and for May and June will be slightly down. And for the second half, only speaking, right now, the memory is more stable than the LCD driver, because of the – our memory customers are more stable and also give us a commitment for the second half. Regarding the driver, only speaking, the pictures here are also of uncertainty, but we will carefully walk step-by-step. And for the second half, we are conservative for the CapEx investment in order to maintain more cash in this uncertain environment. So I hope this can answer your question. Scott Bishins Okay. Where do you think the CapEx would be for the second half? Exactly how much do you spend? S.J. Cheng Previously, the past 2 years, our CapEx investment is around at 25% of total revenue. I think this year, management team set a target to the company, will be less than 20% of our – this year’s revenue. Scott Bishins Okay. That’s great. How much of the revenue growth is coming from higher ASPs or from more unit growth? S.J. Cheng From both, because of the product mix. For LCD driver, as an example, the OLED and TDDI, their penetration rate, getting higher and higher. That is a favorable product mix for us, that being the LCD driver area, there being longer testing time and also more bumping service. And then for – memory wise, more and more customers getting for automobile and industry, that need a higher quality and also more stable forecast for the long term. So – and for quality wise, we also increased a lot because we invest a lot of resource into the separate [indiscernible] for process and also automation in online and AI in online. So like in 2019, our revenue increased around 10%, while our total headcount is reduced around 10%. In case, our gross margin also maintain the variable income continue to increase, and this year will be same. We will try to maintain the same headcount and continue to increase our revenue in order to further contribute the benefit to the company and also share the benefit to the shareholders. Scott Bishins That sounds great. That’s very encouraging. Seeing that there’s tight utilization, are there opportunities for increasing prices also? S.J. Cheng Actually, under the current environment, for memory wise, yes, we see that a little bit. But regarding the LCD driver, I don’t think that is a good timing, yes. Scott Bishins Okay. Do you need a good recovery in the LCD driver between the smartphones and the televisions’ demand to continue on a double-digit growth path? S.J. Cheng Only speaking for this year, I think, the second half LCD driver, pace of the current demand will be a little bit weak compared with the first half due to the weak smartphone demand, yes. Scott Bishins Right. I mean so far, this year, you’ve been on a very strong path the first quarter and looks like April was a very good month, too, actually the best, I guess, in the history of ChipMOS. Do you feel that if we stay on the same product mix that we have today, will that allow us, for full year, to be still at double digits in growth? S.J. Cheng Only speaking, you can – Scott, let me put this for the first half. For the Q1 compared with that period of last year, we increased revenue around 25%. And for the Q2, I think still has around 30% discounted rate. So for the first half, our revenue increase compared with same period last year will be more than 20%. And even we take a very conservative forecast for the second half or it will be same like last year. So maybe we still had a high single-digit revenue growth for – compared with the last year. So we have strong confidence we can deliver good results to the market and also maintain the high cash dividend policy to the shareholder. Scott Bishins That’s great. Considering all the adversity that’s going on now with the virus and the unknowns for us to have a growth trajectory like that for year 2020 is – it’s amazing. It just shows you how well the company is doing and how well you guys are running the whole operation. It’s really great. I have just a couple more questions. I think I saw somewhere in your remarks. It said something about seeing a lot of demand coming from, I guess, for computing from people that are working at home and school also being thwarted at home. Do you see that continuing into the second half also? S.J. Cheng Yes. The answer is yes. Not only for the work from home, but also the other one is very important, it’s gaming requirements. Scott Bishins Okay. Yes, that’s where it seems to be. I’ve seen other reports from other companies, talking about how they’ve lost themselves, I guess, in the retail stores, but they’re picking up a lot of sales that are buying and computers and also other devices that – to use them from home. So that seems like it could be a trend for a while. Is there any more opportunity, you believe, that – I know the gross margins were great at 22.7%. Do you see any chance that, in the short-term, that, that might improve also? S.J. Cheng Through automation and UPS improvement without a new CapEx investment, we try our best to do so. Scott Bishins Okay. I didn’t – I haven’t seen the depreciation numbers. Do they still stay on an upward trend or they start to decline coming into the second half of the year? Silvia Su Yes. For the depreciation, as you know, that we could invest the CapEx, so the depreciation for quarter-over-quarter, it will increase, I think, 3% to 4% quarter-by-quarter for the depreciation. Scott Bishins Okay, when does it start to get down, any time this year or not until next year as your CapEx? Silvia Su Yes, maybe in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2021. Scott Bishins Okay. Yes, I just want to model that into my financials. Let me just see – a couple – just a couple more questions. Is more capacity still moving out of China into Taiwan based on what’s going on with the U.S. tariffs? S.J. Cheng The answer is yes. We take a lot of advantages, especially for U.S., Europe and Japan, a lot of other competitors, which is great and sure. And for auto, they also would like to ask between the capacity for them. Therefore, outside China company. And inside China, we also get lot of like benefit because the coronavirus issue, because the local logistic system will get another impact due to the coronavirus issue. So previously, China is pretty aggressive to the infrastructure by their sales, would like to keep majority in supply chain in China. But right now, this coronavirus issue, they were like 50:50, both in China and outside. So we get a benefit. Scott Bishins Okay. Actually, two more questions. Are you maintaining the normal level of inventory during this pandemic or do you need to stock up because of shortages in components needed to do final assembly? S.J. Cheng Yes. Actually, we increased around two weeks to one month material inventory in order to support the customer, because during this critical period, the transportation and logistics are big issues. That’s first one. The second one is seeing that IC requirement is pretty strong, so material supply lead times are getting longer. So we negotiate with customers with the guarantee. So we expect an increase in our material inventory in order to present enough capacity and materials to support customers. Scott Bishins Okay. Yes, that sounds good. That sounds like it’s the prudent thing to do. One last question, I have been reading a lot of articles about our partner in China, the memory – I believe it’s Tsinghua Memory. S.J. Cheng Yes. Scott Bishins I see there is a lot of reports out that they’re really starting to ramp up their 128 NAND flash components’ chips. And it looks like they say they’re going to be going into full production sometime between – around the end of the year. Is that going to bode well for our China factory as they are now under the same umbrella? S.J. Cheng To answer your question, as you can see, the Q1 result is better than Q4. One of the key reason is Shanghai operation performance improved a lot due to the YMTC support and COF capacity for that – and that’s, I think, for last quarter. Right now, to have the major shareholders into YMTC and new Chairman also is the CEO of the YMTC. So they had a full obligation and apparently to few other Shanghai operations. Scott Bishins How do we stand as far as – are we close to a breakeven? S.J. Cheng I think what we previously laid out has given this very data, yes. After the virus, each of this will be overcome. I think that we will breakeven pretty soon, yes. Scott Bishins Pretty soon. Okay. Well again thank you very much like I said before, this is the best report I’ve seen in many, many years. And it certainly seems like there’s a lot of growth ahead for us. Just continue doing the great job and we’re here. And we’re just very excited about what the future looks like. So thank you very much, to both of you. S.J. Cheng Just go ahead to buy more stock and you will benefit on it, yes. Scott Bishins I will, for sure. S.J. Cheng Thank you. Silvia Su Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] We’ll go next to Vipul Sagar with Blash Capital. Please go ahead. Vipul Sagar Good evening S.J. Good evening Silvia. I just want to say a really impressive April revenue number, really impressive gross margin number. And I was really, really happy about the free cash flow so I just want to ask a question about the rest of the year. Last quarter, you told us that you expect positive free cash flow for the whole year. Is that still the case? Silvia Su Yes. Yes, for 2020, we expect that we can have a positive free cash flow. Yes. Vipul Sagar Okay. And Scott already asked the question about the Shanghai, and that is really impressive that they had a good improvement in the Q1. Down the road, how do we get more information on how it’s contributing to ChipMOS Taiwan? I mean, how do we – do you – are you planning to like include some stuff in your press release about the things that are happening in ChipMOS Shanghai with YMTC being the major shareholder now? Or you just keep that separate? S.J. Cheng Actually, I think according to regulations, we don’t make [indiscernible] regarding the shareholder change. Because they transferred from Unigroup to YMTC, that’s a major shareholder succession. So right now, the one they occupy more than 50% of the share for Shanghai. The company name already changed from ChipMOS Shanghai to Unimos Shanghai. And the YMTC CEO also took the Chairman position of the Unimos Shanghai. And government upped their program, this is China government and also Shanghai given about the R&D project fee and also for the tax incentive. So – and YMTC also supported voting for the proximity. So I think under this kind of situation, the situation will be improved better and better. And YMTC also can benefit from this investor. So this will be a win-win situation. Vipul Sagar Okay. Thank you so much. I just want to say, once again, a really impressive quarter. And obviously, Taiwan is doing so much better with the coronavirus. I mean that government has done an amazing job in keeping its population safe. So thank you, again, and talk to you next quarter. S.J. Cheng Thank you. Silvia Su Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] And it appears we have no questions at this time. I’d like to turn it back to management for closing remarks. S.J. Cheng Yes. Thank you everyone who joined our Q1 conference call. Thank you very much. And please get in touch if you have any further questions. Thank you. Bye-bye. Silvia Su Bye-bye. Operator And that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect. '"

These references only reflect management\\'s expectations and are based upon currently available data. Actual results are always subject to future events, risks and uncertainties which could materially impact the company\\'s actual performance.\\nNow it\\'s my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Guilherme Loureiro.\\nGuilherme Loureiro\\nThank you Pilar and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us to review Walmex fourth quarter and full year results. 2019 was a challenging year. All of you know, we dealt with adverse and uncertain socioeconomic conditions across the region. Nevertheless we\\'re able to deliver and create shareholder value for our customers, associates, shareholders, communities and suppliers.\\nOverall this past year has been a year of transformation investment. I\\'m very proud of our associates\\' hard work and progress. By executing against our strategic priorities and making the right investments we are building a stronger and even more customer-centric business that is positioned for sustainable long-term value creation.\\nI would like to begin by discussing sales performance and then Olga will cover the financial results for the quarter. Please consider that when I talk about Central America, I\\'m making reference to figures on a constant currency basis. During the fourth quarter total revenue grew 4.7%, 5.3% in Mexico and 3.9% in Central America.\\nFor the full year 2019 Mexico grew total revenue by 5.7% and Central America by 3.4% which resulted in 4.9% consolidated revenue growth. Same-store sales continue to be our main growth driver. For the full year Mexico delivered 11.1% 2-year stack growth and Central America 2.5%.\\nIn Mexico all regions and formats delivered a positive performance. The north and south regions had their highest same-store sales growth followed by the center and metro regions which delivered softer growth due to the competitive dynamics and macro conditions in those regions.\\nI will start with Sam\\'s our fastest-growing format for the last four years. In Sam\\'s we are focusing on improving our members\\' experience. So during the quarter, we had another edition of the social fest event, where we offer our members high-quality merchandise with great value especially on fresh items.\\nDuring the event we also reinforced the value proposition for Plus members by offering exclusive items and prices which resulted in the sign-up of thousands of new members.\\nI\\'m very pleased with the progress we have made with Walmart in terms of omnichannel. We have taken their leadership in seasonal events to the online world and successfully executed events such as El Fin Irresistible. We also leveraged our stores\\' network to serve customers in a seamless way and expanded the on-demand service to about 60% of our stores covering 59 seats. We will continue to deepen our digital relationship with our customers to strengthen their loyalty to Walmart even further.\\nAt Superama during the holiday season we\\'re able to surprise our customers with special products and exhibitions primarily focused on fresh categories. We are also enabling our stores with technology such as electronic pricing tags and self-checkout to improve the shopping experience and productivity. Another example of progress in technology is the launch of the new Superama app which improved the conversion and overall customer satisfaction.\\nIn Bodega we are moving forward in terms of store expansion and omnichannel. In quarter four 2019, we opened 69 new stores and closed the year with 2035 stores reinforcing Bodega\\'s position as the leading retailer in Mexico. We also stepped up our omnichannel. We opened more than 300 kiosks during the year taking our omnichannel offer to the most price-sensitive families with great results.\\nAmong our formats, Bodega suffered the greatest impact from the change in disbursement of government support programs, especially in the center and metro regions. The team is focused on reinforcing even further our price positioning and operating more efficiently to keep the productivity loop turning.\\nNow looking at the performance by merchandise division. The Food and Consumables division was our main growth driver followed by general merchandise and apparel. As we have shared with you in past quarters, apparel sales were impacted by operational difficulties that stemmed from the issues we finished with the merchandising board at the beginning of the year.\\nThis has taken us to accelerate the execution of markdowns in order to maintain healthy inventories and resume growth. Our merchandising team is already capitalizing the benefits of the adoption of an end-to-end and more customer-centric way of working. We managed to coordinate the Walmex exclusive omnichannel event called El Fin Irresistible, which included one more day of sales in record time.\\nDuring the event, our customers found amazing merchandise at unbeatable prices across all our formats. We drove double-digit gross sales growth despite a challenging base and e-commerce sales represented 8% of total sales during the event.\\nThe team is also doing a great effort to improve even further our price position. During the year we widened our price gap by 20 basis points to support our most price-sensitive customers in these challenging economic times. In Central America, Nicaragua delivered the highest same-store sales growth followed by Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\\nSales performance in Costa Rica served the greatest impact from the favorable macroeconomic dynamics in the account. During 2019, we expanded Coyol\\'s distribution center in Costa Rica by more than 44000 square meters. With this expansion, the distribution center became the largest one in Central America.\\nWe are committed to continue to invest in Central America not just to reinforce our prices to better serve our customers but also to enable key assets in the region to continue to win in the future. Switching topics. 2019 was a year of good progress in omnichannel. We know the world is changing. Customers are shopping in different ways and we want to be there for them and meet their demand. We believe that in order to scale our omnichannel business and improve profitability, we need to leverage our strength, our stores, our merchant DNA and our service culture.\\nIn line with this we have been working to bring the best of the online and off-line worlds to better serve our customers. We\\'re offering same-day delivery and thousands of everyday needs and about 12,000 general merchandise items for on-demand service in over 256 Walmart and Superama stores.\\nWe are expanding our reach to new customers through an extended catalog composed by recently reinforced 1P for the marketplace, where we have enrolled almost 1300 sellers. Our customers can find the extended offering on our online platforms and across the 894 kiosks operating in our Bodega and Walmart stores. We truly believe our physical footprint is a key competitive advantage and to benefit from it we have now 1,115 pickup locations operating across all formats, where customers can pick up their grocery and general merchandise orders with no additional cost.\\nDuring the quarter, e-commerce sales grew 47% and GMV 53%. It represented 2% of Mexico sales and contributed 70 basis points to total growth. We still have a lot of work to do but I\\'m pleased that our 2019 results demonstrated solid progress against our plan. For the full year, e-commerce sales grew 52% accelerating from the 40% growth achieved in 2018 and GMV grew 61% driven by grocery. E-commerce now represents 1.5% of total Mexico sales and contributed 50 basis points to total sales growth.\\nLooking at performance versus the market. During the quarter we outpaced the self-service and clubs market measured by ANTAD by 50 basis points. For the full year we surpassed ANTAD by 90 basis points. This marks five years growing faster than the competition on every consecutive quarter. We have been able to capitalize on market situations and more important to keep the share gains by winning our customers\\' loyalty with a consistent delivery of our value proposition. I\\'m very proud of the team for this great achievement.\\nMoving to new store growth. During the quarter we opened 81 new stores, 73 in Mexico and nine in Central America. This compares to 57 stores opened in quarter four, 2019 2018. We continue to invest in the region despite an uncertain environment. In the full year we opened 161 stores, which represents the largest number of new store openings in more than five years.\\nIn 2019, new stores contributed 1.7% of total growth, slightly below the guidance, as 50% of the new stores opened during the fourth quarter and sales contribution from store openings in Central America was lower, given the market situation we are facing.\\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of the webcast, this has been a year of investment and we\\'d like to update you on one of our key projects, the logistics network we designed. In 2019, we opened two new distribution centers dedicated to e-commerce in Guadalajara and Monterrey and we expanded Coyol distribution center in Costa Rica. Currently three more distribution centers are under construction: one dedicated to e-commerce in Mexico city and two omni-channel DCs in Mérida and Chihuahua. We expect to open the three of them in the first half of 2020.\\nTo wrap up the first part of the webcast, let\\'s talk about ESG. In October, we launched the Gigaton Project with the goal of avoiding emission of one billion tons of greenhouse effect gases in our value chain by 2025. Our suppliers are key for the success of this initiative. All of them are invited to be part of this effort.\\nWe also launched the second addition of Reciclamania an event for cues along creating a culture of recycling among our customers. We are working to make trust a competitive advantage, building trust for low prices with our associates and for the way we engage with the community we serve. We believe leading on social and environmental issues is good for our business, for our shareholders and for the countries in which we operate and we will continue to focus on these issues going forward.\\nIn summary, we are building the right foundations to better serve our customers and to strengthen our business. As we begin this New Year, we know we will face ongoing economic challenges. We remain focused on our strategic priorities, especially on growth and productivity, while getting all the ingredients in place for a strong omni-channel business.\\nNow, I\\'ll turn it over to Olga, who will cover the financial results.\\nOlga González\\nThanks, Gui, and good afternoon to all of you. In order to provide the investment community a better view of the underlying performance of our business, we\\'re including a retroactive estimation of the effect the adoption of the IFRS 16 will have had on the 2018 financial results.\\nThese pro forma 2018 figures are not audited, but are based on the 2018 audited reported results and adjusted with our best estimates to show the effects related to the adoption of the IFRS 16. Please note that all the reference that I would do to last year results are based on the 2018 pro forma figures.\\nI will start by covering results in Mexico. We\\'re facing a soft growth environment and more challenging competition. Nevertheless, we have been able to generate savings and apply them to improve our price position and maintain healthy inventory levels, while outpacing the market and growing operating income faster than revenues.\\nDuring the fourth quarter, total revenues grew 5.3%. We leveraged expenses by 60 basis points to compensate a gross profit margin contraction of 30 basis points, which stemmed from price investments and from additional markdowns to maintain healthy inventories in the apparel division. Operating income increased 8.1% and EBITDA margin expanded by 20 basis points, reaching 12%.\\nNow let\\'s move to Central America. Please consider that when I\\'m talking about Central America, I am referring to figures on a constant currency basis. Total revenues increased 3.9%. Gross profit margin improved 10 basis points driven by more efficient negotiations with suppliers.\\nAs we announced on the November sales release, we reached a new agreement between our subsidiaries in Central America and Walmart Inc. for the payment of intellectual property royalties. This agreement is effective beginning in 2019, but the charge was registered in November, affecting fourth quarter 2019 SG&A by MXN1.6 billion. However, the underlying performance of the business remained healthy. Excluding this impact, we leveraged expenses by 30 basis points, as a result of a very disciplined productivity agenda that we\\'re implementing across the region and EBITDA improved 100 basis points reaching 11.5%.\\nPlease remember that royalties will be recorded as expenses on a quarterly basis going forward. At a consolidated level, total revenues grew 4.7%. Gross profit increased 3.8% resulting in a 22.7% margin. The net result was impacted by the payment of royalties by MXN1.1 billion.\\nAdjusting for the impact of the payments of royalties on the fourth quarter 2019, we continue to build on our financial strategy. We leveraged expenses by 60 basis points and funded strategic investments in prices, salaries, logistics, e-commerce and new stores. Operating income grew 8.7% ahead of total revenues growth of 4.7%. And EBITDA increased 8.3% reaching, an 11.9% margin.\\nNow, let\\'s review the results for the full year 2019. Mexico total revenues increased 5.7%. During the year, SG&A grew 3.5%, 220 basis points below total revenue growth reflecting our productivity efforts and expense management.\\nGross profit grew 5.3% and gross profit margin decreased by 10 basis points to 22.6%. As a result operating income increased 8.3% and EBITDA 8.6%, resulting in an 11.4% EBITDA margin.\\nIn Central America, total revenues increased 3.4%. Gross profit margin remained stable at 24.2%, as the team was able to reinforce our price leadership without reducing profitability. SG&A grew 10.8% impacted by the new royalty charges. Operating income represented 5.8% of sales and EBITDA margin was 9.1%.\\n2019 results were solid. In both regions, the team made good progress on cost controls and we were able to maintain expenses growth below total revenue growth. This allowed us to invest in prices to keep winning our customers loyalty and to further improve our competitive position.\\nConsolidated revenues increased 4.9%. SG&A increased 4.6%. Gross profit margin decreased 10 basis points to 22.9%. As a result, operating income increased 4.7% and EBITDA margin expanded by 10 basis points.\\nCapital allocation is aligned with the long-term strategy. During 2019, we made strategic investments to better position our business, while continuing to generate returns. In line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, we invested MXN20.6 million, 14.7% more than in 2018. 40% of the investment was allocated to the remodeling and maintenance of existing stores 28% to the opening of new stores, 20% to the logistics network redesign, 11% to technology and e-commerce and 1% to fresh upstreaming projects.\\nIn addition, we\\'re reducing our base expenses by implementing technology to operate more efficiently and becoming more productive in our remodels and new store investments, thereby freeing capital to build strong foundations.\\nMoving to the balance sheet. Our financial strength gave us the ability to deliver short-term results, while we build structural competitive advantages to position the business for the long-term. We closed the year with a cash position of MXN30.9 billion, 20.5% less than last year, given that the dividend paid in 2019 was 41% larger than the one paid in 2018.\\nInventories increased 6.6% primarily impacted by the opening of 81 new stores in the quarter, 24 new stores more than in fourth quarter 2018. Cash generation increased 5.4% ahead of total revenue growth reaching MXN63.7 billion. After investing MXN20.6 billion in higher return projects, we returned MXN36 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We\\'re committed to delivering consistent return to shareholders, while investing for the future.\\nToday, the Walmex Board of Directors agreed to recommend a proposal to shareholders for an ordinary dividend of MXN0.87 per share and an extraordinary dividend of MXN0.92 per share. Total dividends add up to MXN1.79 per share. We expect the Annual Shareholders\\' Meeting to be held on March 24, 2020 to vote on the proposal.\\nThe proposed schedule for dividend payment is as follows. Ordinary dividends will be paid in three installments. The first one of MXN0.27 per share in June, and the second and third ones of MXN0.30 per share in November and December 2020. Extraordinary dividends will be paid in two installments. The first one of MXN0.45 per share on November 2020, and the second one of MXN0.47 per share on December 2020.\\nIn closing, I would like to summarize the highlights of 2019. Despite a challenging environment, our operational standards and clear value proposition have allowed us to continue to grow ahead of the market. We\\'re driving profitability improvement while transforming our company to position it for the future.\\nWe remain confident that the investments we\\'re making in our business are key to balance short and long-term results. We know 2020 will present new challenges. And all of us at Walmex are committed to delivering for our customers and shareholders. Throughout the years, we have built a resilient business capable of adapting to changing economic conditions.\\nTo finalize, I would like to invite you to our Walmex Day, which will be held on March 18 and 19 in Merida, Yucatan. We will be visiting our first omni-channel distribution center, which will further strengthen our network capabilities. You can register for the event with our Investor Relations team.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nEnd of Q&A\\nThank you very much.
